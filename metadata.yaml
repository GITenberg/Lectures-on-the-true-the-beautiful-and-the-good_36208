description: '"Explains that the eighteen lectures that compose this volume have in
  fact the particular trait that they present a regular exposition of the doctrine
  which was at first fixed in our mind, which has not ceased to preside over our labors.
  This book, then, contains the abridged but exact expression of our convictions on
  the fundamental points of philosophic science. In it will be openly seen the method
  that is the soul of our enterprise, our principles, our processes, our results.
  Under these three heads, the True, the Beautiful, the Good, we embrace psychology,
  placed by us at the head of all philosophy, aesthetics, ethics, natural right, even
  public right to a certain extent, finally theodicea, that perilous rendezvous of
  all systems, where different principles are condemned or justified by their consequences.
  It is the affair of our book to plead its own cause. We only desire that it may
  be appreciated and judged according to what it really is, and not according to an
  opinion too much accredited. We declare that eclecticism is very dear to us, for
  it is in our eyes the height of the history of philosophy; but the source of that
  light is elsewhere. Eclecticism is one of the most important and most useful applications
  of the philosophy which we teach, but it is not its principle. Our true doctrine,
  our true flag is spiritualism, that philosophy as solid as generous, which began
  with Socrates and Plato, which the Gospel has spread abroad in the world, and which
  Descartes put under the severe forms of modern genius. May our voice be heard by
  new generations as it was by the serious youth of the Restoration!"--Preface. (PsycINFO
